# TPP Explorer for Gene Drive Diagnostic Tools

This interactive tool allows users to explore test performance profiles for gene drive detection.

## Tabs Overview

- **Output 1**: Plot required sample size vs. test sensitivity for different pool sizes.
- **Output 2**: Plot required sample size vs. specificity for different pool sizes.
- **Output 3**: Heatmap of standard error across sensitivity and specificity ranges.

## How to Use

1. Select a tab for the desired figure.
2. Input gene drive frequency (`x`), desired detection probability, or acceptable false positive rate.
3. Provide comma-separated pool sizes (e.g., `1,5,10`).
4. Review the dynamically generated plot.
